CURRENT VERSION: v0.0.3

v0.0.1
-Working with only a gradebook for a specific course section now, so some functions are unused. The plan in the future is to make it for all students in all courses I would teach.

v0.0.2
-Added CMAKE building to the project using these commands in VS Code PowerShell in the root directory of GradebookSystem.
-Built successfully.
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force build
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ".." -G "MinGW Makefiles"
mingw32-make
-Removed unnecessary defective includes in classes with circular dependencies, primarily CourseBase, CourseSection and Student. Turns out the includes are not needed if only a pointer or reference is used on that data type.
-The exe is built as GradebookSystem.exe in the build folder. PowerShell does not allow direct command loading, so .\GradebookSystem.exe loaded it.
-Program ran but the text file failed to open.
-Rebuild file with command
    cmake --build .
    Run with
    .\GradebookSystem.exe
-Named GradebookSystem.exe because of this line in CMakeLists.text
    add_executable(GradebookSystem ${SOURCES})

v0.0.3
-Iterating through all courses, sections and their students in main.cpp.
-Submitted.
-Updated README and explained classes.
